# How to contribute to Things.do

For bugs and feature requests, ensure the issue hasn't already been posted, and if not, post it in [issues](https://github.com/danielh-official/things.do/issues).

For anything relating to security (e.g., an unauthorized third party finding a way to get access to user data), please do not post that publicly. If this application gains more traction, I will set up a security policy with information on how to best contact me for such topics.

For contributing code, fork this repository, open a branch from the main branch, and, when completed, open a pull request to the upstream repository.
